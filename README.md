# x86 for Nova

This extension provides syntax highlighting support for the x86 (and x86-64) assembly language in [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/).

It is based off the work of [Dan C Underwood](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/Arm.novaextension) which is based off of his extensions for [VSCode](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/vscode-arm), [Atom](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/language-arm), and [Sublime Text](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/ARM-ASM-Sublime), which in turn were based off of drd's fork of foxostro's x86 Assembly bundle for Sublime Text, which was developed from amorrow's PIC Assembly bundle.
