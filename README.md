# x86 for Nova

This extension provides syntax highlighting support for the x86 (and x86-64) assembly language in [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/).

It is based off the work of [Sublimeassembly 2](https://github.com/Nessphoro/sublimeassembly) and [Dan C Underwood](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/Arm.novaextension).
